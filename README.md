# R-package-for-extracting-vegetation-phenology-metrics-from-raster-time-series
phenoraster is an R package for extracting vegetation phenology metrics (Start of Season, Peak of Season, End of Season) from raster time series, either globally or regionally. Example workflows are provided using CMIP6 GPP data, but the package works for any regularly sampled raster time series.
